## Lessons Learned
I've learned how to use technology, how to commit to a project, how to collaborate with others, and how to clearly comprehend how to integrate client-side and server-side web components in a three-tier web architecture through this project. The most difficult technical challenge to solve that has emerged in this second week is: Form validation, href link format, report generation, wamp, and Xampp server mismatch are some of these technical problems. I was able to eventually get over the challenges of form validation by integrating PHP form validation in the login page, registration form, etc. The second assignment was successfully accomplished by me using only the Xampp web server, but I'll also try to create reports.
